Hi there friend,
welcome to the decentraland minesweeper demo!

in the following steps you'll be installing the SDK and its prerequisite,
then running the demo locally through your browser. it doesn't matter where
you place this folder, just put it where ever you want!

(-- STEP 1 --)
to run the SDK you'll need to install node.js first which can be found here:

https://nodejs.org/

(-- STEP 2 --)
next you'll need to install the SDK, to do so all you have to do is run the
provided .bat 'sdk_setup'

.bat files are simply files holding lines of code for your command line. if
your bat is failing you may need to run it as an administrator

(-- STEP 3 --)
modify the local_test.bat file (this can be done with any text editor) to
link to where you placed the project folder. this .bat will be used to 
easily launch the demo

replace <disk> with the current disk location eg. F:
replace <file path> with the location of the folder eg. F:\Decentraland - Minesweeper

(-- STEP 3 --)
you can now run local_test.bat and the demo should open in your default browser!
when you are done playing either close the console window or input 'ctrl + c'

(-- END NOTES --)
all the demo code is stored in src/game.ts. this project is meant as both a demo of 
what can be done in decentraland and as a learning tool for those looking to build.
feel free to look at/modify the code!

Thanks for downloading, hope you have fun!
